Reason why I learn React. React help me to create Dynamic Application . 

So what is a Dynamic Application ? 

When the Application inside ram or it's running , I can interact with that Application based on input/event it's generate UI change . React full feel 
my need and if I go to technical react use batch update and it's achieve 
by VD(virtual dom) . VD help browser re-render less and update DOM element 
efficently .
React create an illution that a singel page have muti-page application using component and state . State with 0/1 is only change little but if the state
is object then it will be mangaed muti-page.
